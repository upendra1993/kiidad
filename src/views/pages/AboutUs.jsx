                                We first launched our business through online platforms on September 24, 2020. From September 2020 to August 2021, we had the opportunity to become popular among the people under the brand name 'DAD' and to become their favorite brand. However, due to our strong desire to further develop our business overseas through the online platforms, we chose 'KIIDAD' as our long-term business brand name and are now conducting our business through it. 
                                </p>
                                <p>At present we are expanding our business through the online platforms as well as working with some of the leading textile companies in Sri Lanka. Our main theme is 'Worn With Pride.' We provide our clothes to be worn with pride by all.
                                </p>
                               <p> We always look forward to the happiness of our customers and success in their lives. So we make our clothes and deliver them to wear with pride for the sake of success. Thus, all the proud people can join us.
                               </p>
                                <p>And our main mark is the lightning. Lightning signifies energy. We cannot calculate or store the energy of  lightning. We equate all people with lightning and see them as strong people. Everyone has energy like lightning. So we deliver them our clothes to wear with pride for their success, for the victory of their lives.

                                </p>
